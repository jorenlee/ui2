            address, and cell phone number (if you provide it to us to receive

          <p class="mb-2">
            When you interact with library websites or access online journals or

            address, browser and operating system used, date and time of login,

            The LRC receives data directly from you when you complete the forms,
            submit requests, and so on.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-bold">2.2 Automatically</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Most of the Library’s systems generate and store data based on
            system visits and online interactions with LRC and third-party
            resources.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-bold">2.3 From External Sources</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            We use Google Analytics, which provides website traffic statistics.

            being used and to improve our interface and services.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-bold">How We Use LRC Data</h2>
          <p class="mb-2">

          <h2 class="font-bold">How We Share LRC Data</h2>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Access to library data is safeguarded through several mechanisms,
            including university policy, Institutional Review Board, LSU Data
            Privacy Office, professional standards (e.g. Standards for
            Philippine Libraries), and Philippine Law.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-bold">4.1 Service Providers</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            The LRC engages service providers, such as software vendors, to
            support library systems and services. For example, when you request
            and use materials from the Special Collection Section, your identity
            and a record of the materials you use are stored on the vendor’s
            site. We require our service providers to keep your personal
            information secure and use it only for providing services on the
            university’s behalf.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-bold">4.2 Third-party/Licensed Content Providers</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            The LRC offers services and/or content such as online journals and
            subject databases from third-party vendors. When you follow a link
            from the library website to a third-party site, your interaction
            with these systems will be governed by those sites’ individual
            privacy policies. The majority of content providers rely on IP
            authentication and the LRC provides no additional personal
            information.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-bold">4.3 Other Research Institutions</h3>
          <p class="mb-2">
            As part of research grants or projects, the LRC may share anonymized
            transaction logs with specific academic institutions and service
            providers involved in the grant, providing the researchers have
            obtained Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and established a
            memorandum of understanding about data use and retention with the
            LRC.
